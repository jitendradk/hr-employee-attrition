This project is based on HR attrition project using python.

This is part of my first project to help HR Advisories to detect employees who may end up quitting the organization. The data was sourced from HRMS where the details of all past and current employees were being recorded for last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is classification where we can judge if employee is likely to quit or not.
